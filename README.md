# Ender's Bane
A datapack for Minecraft 1.14.4 and up which is based on filling the Nether and End with more content. Currently with 20 additional items, 3 new monsters, and with much more planned.

# Getting Started
Throwing an ender pearl on a dropped book will summon a long lost guide to adventurer's magic. This is the in-game guide to the datapack, and will change with each new release. However, a more comprehensive guide will be available online, should you choose to use it.
